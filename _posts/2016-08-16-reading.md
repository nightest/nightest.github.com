### Reading

Reading is important for we humans to inherite knowledge. Nowadays, We also learn from books, study knowledges in books. However, several we have to notice when reading. First of all, We shoud pick out right books to read. What books are right? That depends on what we want and what we can get. If you want to relax, read some scitific fiction, novels and so on. If you want to lean something, read some books you are interested. Or, if you wan to improve yourself, read some books you should know. Second, We need to control ourselves in reading, especially in reading for relax. When I read some amazing novels, sometimes I can't help to read till midnight or even keep reading the total night till next morning. Acturally, it goes to the opposite direction when we look back to our targets. We read novels for relax, however, if we relax with these sleepless night, we would become more tired with no doubt.
